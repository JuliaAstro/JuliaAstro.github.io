This team has developed a novel and efficient emulator designed for the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS).

**Package: [CosmologicalEmulators/Effort.jl](https://github.com/sefffal/Octofitter.jl)**

Their implementation leverages state-of-the-art numerical methods and machine learning techniques from the [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) and [Turing.jl](https://turinglang.org/) ecosystems to create surrogate models of the large-scale structure of the Universe. These models integrate well with gradient-based samplers to achieve exceptional computational performance without sacrificing accuracy, which will be essential for analyzing next-generation cosmological survey data from, e.g., the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument ([DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/)), and [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid).
