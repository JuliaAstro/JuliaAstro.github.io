A new result from the team behind [Comrade.jl](@ref) at the [Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/) has discovered an unexpected flip in the measured polarization of the magnetic fields around the supermassive black hole, M87*. Using Julia, this team was able to detect the magnetic spirals first spiraling one way in 2017, settling in 2018, and then reversing direction in 2021, indicating a dynamic environment with changing  polarization patterns.
