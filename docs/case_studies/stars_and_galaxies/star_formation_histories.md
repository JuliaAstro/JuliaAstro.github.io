This team has developed a modular, open-source code for measuring resolved SFHs with a focus on model flexibility for these types of population parameters.

**Package: [cgarling/StarFormationHistories.jl](https://github.com/cgarling/StarFormationHistories.jl)**

This paper demonstrates its application to JWST/NIRCAM data of a dwarf irregular galaxy in the Local Group, and to HST/ACS data of an ultrafaint Milky Way satellite dwarf galaxy.
