This team provides analytic light curve models incorporating polynomial limb-darkening.

**Package: [rodluger/Limbdark.jl](https://github.com/rodluger/Limbdark.jl)**

These models can be used to rapidly model multi-planetary transit and eclipse light curves. See their paper published in _The Astronomical Journal_ below, along with their follow-up work in [ericagol/NBodyGradient.jl](@ref ericagol-nbodygradient) and [langfzac/Photodynamics.jl](@ref langfzac-photodynamics), for more:
