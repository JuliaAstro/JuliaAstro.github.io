This team provides analytic light curve models incorporating polynomial limb-darkening.

Building on [ericagol/NbodyGradient](@ref ericagol-NbodyGradient), this team combines transit models from [rodluger/limbdark]() to create full photodynamic models.


These models can then be used to model multi-planetary transit light curves. See their paper published in MNRAS below for more:
