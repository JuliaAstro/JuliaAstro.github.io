This team uses Julia to develop a fast and accurate N-body code to study the multi-planetary [TRAPPIST-1 system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAPPIST-1).

**Package: [ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl](https://github.com/ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl)**

This is accomplished by using a novel method to obtain the derivatives of the transit times with respect to the initial conditions and masses using the chain rule, which is quicker and more accurate than using finite differences or automatic differentiation.
