Building on [ericagol/NbodyGradient](@ref ericagol-NbodyGradient), this team combines transit models from [rodluger/limbdark]() to create full photodynamic models.

**Package: [langfzac/Photodynamics.jl](https://github.com/ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl)**

These models can then be used to model multi-planetary transit light curves. See their paper published in MNRAS below for more:
