Building on [ericagol/NbodyGradient.jl](@ref ericagol-nbodygradient), this team combines transit models from [rodluger/Limbdark.jl](@ref rodluger-limbdark) to create full photodynamic models.

**Package: [langfzac/Photodynamics.jl](https://github.com/langfzac/Photodynamics.jl)**

**[ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.540..106L/abstract)**

These models can then be used to model multi-planetary transit light curves. See their paper published in _MNRAS_ below for more:
