The [Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE)](https://www.gov.br/inpe/) uses [SatelliteToolbox.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSpace/SatelliteToolbox.jl) to plan its current and future Earth satellite missions.

Led by mission architect [Dr. Ronan Arraes Jardim Chagas](https://ronanarraes.com/), this team used Julia to perform several mission critical tasks to launch and maintain their Amazonia-1 satellite, including:

* General mission analysis such as fuel budget computation, orbit planning, ground station visibility analysis, etc.
* Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) simulations
* AOCS telemetry analysis
* In-orbit sensor calibration
