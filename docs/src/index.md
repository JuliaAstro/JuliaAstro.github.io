# JuliaAstro

JuliaAstro and its affiliated organizations are a community for astronomy in Julia. We strive to foster an ecosystem of packages that interoperate well with each other for a wide variety of different domains ranging from solar system science to large-scale cosmology. As part of the larger Julia ecosystem, our mission is to provide code that is fast, dynamic, composable, and reproducible.

Further documentation for curated packages in the JuliaAstro and larger Julia astronomy ecosystem can be viewed directly via the navbar above. Pure Julia packages are marked with a closed circle ⬤, while wrapper packages for other languages are marked with an open circle ◯. We also provide a brief summary for each on our [Package Ecosystem](@ref eco) page.
