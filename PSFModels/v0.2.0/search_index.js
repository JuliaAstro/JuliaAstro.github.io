These models act like matrices but without allocating any memory, which makes them efficient to fit and apply.\n\nModels\n\nThe following models are currently implemented\n\nPSFModels.Gaussian\nPSFModels.AiryDisk\nPSFModels.Moffat\n\nParameters\n\nIn general, the PSFs have a position, a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) measure, and an amplitude. The position a 1-based pixel coordinate system, where (1, 1) represents the center of the bottom left pixel. This matches the indexing style of Julia as well as DS9, IRAF, SourceExtractor, and WCS. If a position is not specified, it is set to (0, 0). The FWHM is a consistent scale parameter for the models. All models support a scalar (isotropic) FWHM and a FWHM for each axis (diagonal).\n\nUsage\n\nUsing the models should feel just like an array. In fact, PSFModels.PSFModel <: AbstractMatrix. However, no data is stored and no allocations have to be made. In other words, representing the models as matrices is merely a convenience, since typically astronomical data is stored in dense arrays.\n\njulia> m = PSFModels.Gaussian(5); # fwhm of 5 pixels, centered at (0, 0)\n\njulia> m[0, 0] # [y, x] for indexing\n1.0\n\njulia> m(0, 0) # (x, y) for evaluating\n1.0\n\nnote: axis order\nIt's important to note the difference in the axis ordering between the index-style calls and the function-style calls. The index-style calls are reverse cartesian order (e.g., (z, y, x)), while function calls are the typical cartesian order (x, y, z). Regardless, the constructors are always in cartesian order ((x, y, z)).\n\nTo control the amplitude, the best method is using scalar multiplication or division. These operations create another lazy object (ScaledPSFModel) that scales the original model without having to broadcast and potentially allocate.\n\njulia> m_scaled = 20 * m;\n\njulia> m_scaled(0, 0)\n20.0\n\njulia> m′ = m_scaled / 20;\n\njulia> m′(0, 0)\n1.0\n\nBecause the model is a matrix, it needs to have a size. In this case, the size is maxsize * FWHM pixels, centered around the origin, and rounded up. We can see how this alters the indices from a typical Matrix\n\njulia> size(m)\n(17, 17)\n\njulia> axes(m)\n(-8:8, -8:8)\n\nif we want to collect the model into a dense matrix, regardless of the indexing (e.g. to prepare for cross-correlation), we can simply\n\njulia> stamp = collect(m);\n\nthese axes are merely a convenience for bounding the model, since they accept any real number as input.\n\njulia> m[100, 10000] # index-like inputs [y, x]\n0.0\n\njulia> m(2.4, 1.7) # valid for any real (x, y)\n0.38315499005194587\n\nBy bounding the model, we get a cutout which can be applied to arrays with much larger dimensions without having to iterate over the whole matrix\n\njulia> big_mat = ones(101, 101);\n\njulia> model = PSFModels.Gaussian(51, 51, 2); # center of big_mat, fwhm=2\n\njulia> ax = map(intersect, axes(big_mat), axes(model))\n(48:54, 48:54)\n\njulia> cutout = @view big_mat[ax...]\n7×7 view(::Array{Float64,2}, 48:54, 48:54) with eltype Float64:\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0\n\njulia> stamp = @view model[ax...];\n\njulia> photsum = sum(cutout .* stamp)\n4.5322418212890625\n\nNice- we only had to reduce ~50 pixels instead of ~10,000 to calculate the aperture sum, all in under a microsecond (on my machine).\n\nSince the models are lazy, that means the type of the output can be specified, as long as it can be converted to from a real number (so no integer types).\n\njulia> mbig = PSFModels.Gaussian{BigFloat}(12);\n\njulia> sum(mbig)\n163.07467408408593790971336380361822460116627553361468017101287841796875\n\nfinally, we provide plotting recipes from RecipesBase.jl, which can be seen in use in the API/Reference section.\n\nusing Plots\nmodel = PSFModels.Gaussian(8)\nplot(model)              # default axes\nplot(model, 1:5, 1:5)    # custom axes\nplot(model, axes(other)) # use axes from other array\n\ntip: Tip: Automatic Differentation\nForward-mode AD libraries tend to use dual numbers, which can cause headaches getting the types correct.
