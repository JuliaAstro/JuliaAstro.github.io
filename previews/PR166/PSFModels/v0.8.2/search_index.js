This model is fit to the data in image at the specified inds (by default, the entire array). To pass extra keyword arguments to the model (i.e., to \"freeze\" a parameter), pass them in a named tuple to func_kwargs. The default loss function is the chi-squared loss, which uses the the square of the difference (i.e., the L2 norm). You can change this to the L1 norm, for example, by passing loss=abs. The maximum FWHM can be set with maxfwhm as a number or tuple.\n\nAdditional keyword arguments, as well as the fitting algorithm alg, are passed to Optim.optimize as an Optim.Option. By default we use forward-mode auto-differentiation (AD) to derive Jacobians for the Newton with Trust Region optimization algorithm. Refer to the Optim.jl documentation for more information.\n\nChoosing parameters\n\nThe fit function is very powerful because it gives you a great amount of flexibility in the way you fit your models. To demonstrate this, let's start with a simple isotropic gaussian.\n\nmodel = gaussian\n# match params to arguments of PSF\nparams = (x=20, y=20, fwhm=3, amp=1)\n\nNote that params can follow any order\n\nparams = (amp=1, x=20, y=20, fwhm=3)\n\nNow, to extend this interface to the bivariate PSF case, where fwhm is two values, all you need to do is use a tuple or vector\n\nparams = (x=20, y=20, fwhm=(3, 3))\n\nand, again, the order does not matter\n\nmodel = moffat\nparams = (alpha=1, x=20, y=20, fwhm=3, amp=10)\n\nFitting a PSF\n\nAfter selecting your model and parameters, fitting data is easy\n\nP = (x=12, y=13, fwhm=13.2, amp=0.1)\npsf = gaussian.(CartesianIndicies(1:25, 1:15); P...)\n\nparams, synthpsf = PSFModels.fit(gaussian, P, psf)\n\nhere params is a named tuple of the best fitting parameters. It will not include any fixed parameters.\n\nsynthpsf is the best-fitting model, for direct comparison with the input data.\n\npsf_fit = synthpsf.(CartesianIndicies(psf))\n\nTo alter parameters without fitting them (i.e., \"freeze\" them) use func_kwargs\n\nP = (x=12, y=13, fwhm=(12.4, 13.2), amp=0.1)\nfunc_kwargs = (alpha=2)\nparams, synthpsf = PSFModels.fit(moffat, P, psf;
