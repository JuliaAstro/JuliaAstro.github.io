For many  applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.\nIf hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station  in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB),  is available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from  the expression\nhm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );\nwhere tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K  (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section  52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be  estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as  follows:\nphpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );\nNote, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to  the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for  precise work.\nThe argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in  micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to  occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).\nThe accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for  refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.  Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and  there are no gross local effects, the predicted observed  coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec  (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better  than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better  than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.\nWithout refraction, the complementary functions atco13 and  atoc13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond  all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,  consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still  better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.\n\"Observed\" Az,ZD means the position that would be seen by a  perfect geodetically aligned theodolite.  (Zenith distance is  used rather than altitude in order to reflect the fact that no  allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)  This is  related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using  the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the  observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation  angle and the site longitude.  \"Observed\" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus  means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial  with its polar axis aligned to the Earth's axis of rotation.\nIt is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely  values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in  accordance with the models used.\n\nCalled\n\napco13: astrometry parameters, ICRS-observed, 2013\natciq: quick ICRS to CIRS\natioq: quick CIRS to observed\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.atic13-NTuple{4, Any}","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.atic13","text":"atic13(ri, di, date1, date2)\n\nTransform star RA,Dec from geocentric CIRS to ICRS astrometric.\n\nGiven\n\nri, di: CIRS geocentric RA,Dec (radians)\ndate1: TDB as a 2-part...\ndate2: ...Julian Date (Note 1)\n\nReturned\n\nrc, dc: ICRS astrometric RA,Dec (radians)\neo: Equation of the origins (ERA-GST, Note 4)\n\nNotes\n\nThe TDB date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between the two arguments.

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.

Very close to solar system bodies, additional errors of up to several milliarcseconds can occur because of unmodeled light deflection;  however, the Sun's contribution is taken into account, to first order.  The accuracy limitations of the ERFA function epv00 (used to compute Earth position and velocity) can contribute aberration errors of up to 5 microarcseconds.  Light deflection at the Sun's limb is uncertain at the 0.4 mas level.\nShould the transformation to (equinox based) J2000.0 mean place be required rather than (CIO based) ICRS coordinates, subtract the equation of the origins from the returned right ascension: RA = RI - EO.

For many  applications, xp and yp can be set to zero.\nIf hm, the height above the ellipsoid of the observing station  in meters, is not known but phpa, the pressure in hPa (=mB), is  available, an adequate estimate of hm can be obtained from the  expression\nhm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( phpa / 1013.25 );\nwhere tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K  (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section  52).  Similarly, if the pressure phpa is not known, it can be  estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as  follows:\nphpa = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );\nNote, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to  the pressure and that an accurate phpa value is important for  precise work.\nThe argument wl specifies the observing wavelength in  micrometers.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to  occur at 100 micrometers (about 3000 GHz).\nThe accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for  refraction, which use a simple A*tan(z) + B*tan^3(z) model.  Providing the meteorological parameters are known accurately and  there are no gross local effects, the predicted astrometric  coordinates should be within 0.05 arcsec (optical) or 1 arcsec  (radio) for a zenith distance of less than 70 degrees, better  than 30 arcsec (optical or radio) at 85 degrees and better  than 20 arcmin (optical) or 30 arcmin (radio) at the horizon.\nWithout refraction, the complementary functions atio13 and  atoi13 are self-consistent to better than 1 microarcsecond  all over the celestial sphere.  With refraction included,  consistency falls off at high zenith distances, but is still  better than 0.05 arcsec at 85 degrees.\nIt is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely  values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in  accordance with the models used.\n\nCalled\n\napio13: astrometry parameters, CIRS-observed, 2013\natoiq: quick observed to CIRS\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.atoiq-NTuple{4, Any}","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.atoiq","text":"atoiq(typeofcoordinates, ob1, ob2, astrom)\n\nQuick observed place to CIRS, given the star-independent astrometry parameters.\n\nUse of this function is appropriate when efficiency is important and where many star positions are all to be transformed for one date.

To guard against gross errors, a year five or more after the release year of the present function (see the constant IYV) is considered dubious.  In this case a warning status is returned but the result is computed in the normal way.\nFor both too-early and too-late years, the warning status is +1. This is distinct from the error status -1, which signifies a year so early that JD could not be computed.\nIf the specified date is for a day which ends with a leap second, the TAI-UTC value returned is for the period leading up to the leap second.  If the date is for a day which begins as a leap second ends, the TAI-UTC returned is for the period following the leap second.\nThe day number must be in the normal calendar range, for example 1 through 30 for April.  The \"almanac\" convention of allowing such dates as January 0 and December 32 is not supported in this function, in order to avoid confusion near leap seconds.\nThe fraction of day is used only for dates before the introduction of leap seconds, the first of which occurred at the end of 1971.  It is tested for validity (0 to 1 is the valid range) even if not used;  if invalid, zero is used and status -4 is returned.  For many applications, setting fd to zero is acceptable;  the resulting error is always less than 3 ms (and occurs only pre-1972).\nThe status value returned in the case where there are multiple errors refers to the first error detected.

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nAlthough the date is, formally, barycentric dynamical time (TDB), the terrestrial dynamical time (TT) can be used with no practical effect on the accuracy of the prediction.\nTT can be regarded as a coordinate time that is realized as an offset of 32.184s from International Atomic Time, TAI.  TT is a specific linear transformation of geocentric coordinate time TCG, which is the time scale for the Geocentric Celestial Reference System, GCRS.\nTDB is a coordinate time, and is a specific linear transformation of barycentric coordinate time TCB, which is the time scale for the Barycentric Celestial Reference System, BCRS.\nThe difference TCG-TCB depends on the masses and positions of the bodies of the solar system and the velocity of the Earth.  It is dominated by a rate difference, the residual being of a periodic character.  The latter, which is modeled by the present function, comprises a main (annual) sinusoidal term of amplitude approximately 0.00166 seconds, plus planetary terms up to about 20 microseconds, and lunar and diurnal terms up to 2 microseconds. These effects come from the changing transverse Doppler effect and gravitational red-shift as the observer (on the Earth's surface) experiences variations in speed (with respect to the BCRS) and gravitational potential.\nTDB can be regarded as the same as TCB but with a rate adjustment to keep it close to TT, which is convenient for many applications. The history of successive attempts to define TDB is set out in Resolution 3 adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2006, which defines a fixed TDB(TCB) transformation that is consistent with contemporary solar-system ephemerides.  Future ephemerides will imply slightly changed transformations between TCG and TCB, which could introduce a linear drift between TDB and TT;  however, any such drift is unlikely to exceed 1 nanosecond per century.\nThe geocentric TDB-TT model used in the present function is that of Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990), in its full form.  It was originally supplied by Fairhead (private communications with P.T.Wallace, 1990) as a Fortran subroutine.  The present C function contains an adaptation of the Fairhead code.  The numerical results are essentially unaffected by the changes, the differences with respect to the Fairhead & Bretagnon original being at the 1e-20 s level.\nThe topocentric part of the model is from Moyer (1981) and Murray (1983), with fundamental arguments adapted from Simon et al. 1994.  It is an approximation to the expression ( v / c ) . ( r / c ), where v is the barycentric velocity of the Earth, r is the geocentric position of the observer and c is the speed of light.\nBy supplying zeroes for u and v, the topocentric part of the model can be nullified, and the function will return the Fairhead & Bretagnon result alone.\nDuring the interval 1950-2050, the absolute accuracy is better than +/- 3 nanoseconds relative to time ephemerides obtained by direct numerical integrations based on the JPL DE405 solar system ephemeris.\nIt must be stressed that the present function is merely a model, and that numerical integration of solar-system ephemerides is the definitive method for predicting the relationship between TCG and TCB and hence between TT and TDB.\n\nReferences\n\nFairhead, L., & Bretagnon, P., Astron.Astrophys., 229, 240-247   (1990).\nIAU 2006 Resolution 3.\nMcCarthy, D.

The limited accuracy of the present algorithm is such that any of the methods is satisfactory.\nThis function is a full implementation of the algorithm published by Meeus (see reference) except that the light-time correction to the Moon's mean longitude has been omitted.\nComparisons with ELP/MPP02 over the interval 1950-2100 gave RMS errors of 2.9 arcsec in geocentric direction, 6.1 km in position and 36 mm/s in velocity.  The worst case errors were 18.3 arcsec in geocentric direction, 31.7 km in position and 172 mm/s in velocity.\nThe original algorithm is expressed in terms of \"dynamical time\", which can either be TDB or TT without any significant change in accuracy.  UT cannot be used without incurring significant errors (30 arcsec in the present era) due to the Moon's 0.5 arcsec/sec movement.\nThe result is with respect to the GCRS (the same as J2000.0 mean equator and equinox to within 23 mas).\nVelocity is obtained by a complete analytical differentiation of the Meeus model.\nThe Meeus algorithm generates position and velocity in mean ecliptic coordinates of date, which the present function then rotates into GCRS.  Because the ecliptic system is precessing, there is a coupling between this spin (about 1.4 degrees per century) and the Moon position that produces a small velocity contribution.  In the present function this effect is neglected as it corresponds to a maximum difference of less than 3 mm/s and increases the RMS error by only 0.4%.\n\nReferences\n\nMeeus, J., Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd edition, Willmann-Bell, 1998, p337.\nSimon, J.L., Bretagnon, P., Chapront, J., Chapront-Touze, M., Francou, G. & Laskar, J., Astron.Astrophys., 1994, 282, 663\n\nCalled\n\ns2pv: spherical coordinates to pv-vector\npfw06: bias-precession F-W angles, IAU 2006\nir: initialize r-matrix to identity\nrz: rotate around Z-axis\nrx: rotate around X-axis\nrxpv: product of r-matrix and pv-vector\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.num00a","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.num00a","text":"num00a(date1, date2)\n\nForm the matrix of nutation for a given date, IAU 2000A model.\n\nGiven\n\ndate1, date2: TT as a 2-part Julian Date (Note 1)\n\nReturned\n\nrmatn: Nutation matrix\n\nNotes\n\nThe TT date date1+date2 is a Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between the two arguments.

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nThe nutation components in longitude and obliquity are in radians and with respect to the equinox and ecliptic of date.  The obliquity at J2000.0 is assumed to be the Lieske et al. (1977) value of 84381.448 arcsec.\nBoth the luni-solar and planetary nutations are included.  The latter are due to direct planetary nutations and the perturbations of the lunar and terrestrial orbits.\nThe function computes the MHB2000 nutation series with the associated corrections for planetary nutations.  It is an implementation of the nutation part of the IAU 2000A precession- nutation model, formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000, namely MHB2000 (Mathews et al. 2002), but with the free core nutation (FCN - see Note 4) omitted.\nThe full MHB2000 model also contains contributions to the nutations in longitude and obliquity due to the free-excitation of the free-core-nutation during the period 1979-2000.  These FCN terms, which are time-dependent and unpredictable, are NOT included in the present function and, if required, must be independently computed.  With the FCN corrections included, the present function delivers a pole which is at current epochs accurate to a few hundred microarcseconds.  The omission of FCN introduces further errors of about that size.\nThe present function provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000 algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates. These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession adjustments, are supported by the ERFA functions bi00  and pr00.\nThe MHB2000 algorithm also provides \"total\" nutations, comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments, luni-solar nutation and planetary nutation.  These total nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession implementation, such as pmat76,  to deliver GCRS- to-true predictions of sub-mas accuracy at current dates. However, there are three shortcomings in the MHB2000 model that must be taken into account if more accurate or definitive results are required (see Wallace 2002):\nThe MHB2000 total nutations are simply arithmetic sums, yet in reality the various components are successive Euler rotations.  This slight lack of rigor leads to cross terms that exceed 1 mas after a century.  The rigorous procedure is to form the GCRS-to-true rotation matrix by applying the bias, precession and nutation in that order.\nAlthough the precession adjustments are stated to be with respect to Lieske et al. (1977), the MHB2000 model does not specify which set of Euler angles are to be used and how the adjustments are to be applied.  The most literal and straightforward procedure is to adopt the 4-rotation epsilon0, psiA, omegaA, xiA option, and to add DPSIPR to psiA and DEPSPR to both omegaA and eps_A.\nThe MHB2000 model predates the determination by Chapront et al. (2002) of a 14.6 mas displacement between the J2000.0 mean equinox and the origin of the ICRS frame.  It should, however, be noted that neglecting this displacement when calculating star coordinates does not lead to a 14.6 mas change in right ascension, only a small second- order distortion in the pattern of the precession-nutation effect.\nFor these reasons, the ERFA functions do not generate the \"total nutations\" directly, though they can of course easily be generated by calling bi00, pr00 and the present function and adding the results.\nThe MHB2000 model contains 41 instances where the same frequency appears multiple times, of which 38 are duplicates and three are triplicates.  To keep the present code close to the original MHB algorithm, this small inefficiency has not been corrected.\n\nCalled\n\nfal03: mean anomaly of the Moon\nfaf03: mean argument of the latitude of the Moon\nfaom03: mean longitude of the Moon's ascending node\nfame03: mean longitude of Mercury\nfave03: mean longitude of Venus\nfae03: mean longitude of Earth\nfama03: mean longitude of Mars\nfaju03: mean longitude of Jupiter\nfasa03: mean longitude of Saturn\nfaur03: mean longitude of Uranus\nfapa03: general accumulated precession in longitude\n\nReferences\n\nChapront, J., Chapront-Touze, M. & Francou, G. 2002,   Astron.Astrophys. 387, 700\nLieske, J.H., Lederle, T., Fricke, W. & Morando, B. 1977,   Astron.Astrophys. 58, 1-16\nMathews, P.M., Herring, T.A., Buffet, B.A. 2002, J.Geophys.Res.   107, B4.

(The errors that result from using this function with the IAU 2006 value of 84381.406 arcsec can be neglected.)\nThe nutation model consists only of luni-solar terms, but includes also a fixed offset which compensates for certain long- period planetary terms (Note 7).\nThis function is an implementation of the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model formally adopted by the IAU General Assembly in 2000. The function computes the MHB2000SHORT luni-solar nutation series (Luzum 2001), but without the associated corrections for the precession rate adjustments and the offset between the GCRS and J2000.0 mean poles.\nThe full IAU 2000A (MHB2000) nutation model contains nearly 1400 terms.  The IAU 2000B model (McCarthy & Luzum 2003) contains only 77 terms, plus additional simplifications, yet still delivers results of 1 mas accuracy at present epochs.  This combination of accuracy and size makes the IAU 2000B abridged nutation model suitable for most practical applications.\nThe function delivers a pole accurate to 1 mas from 1900 to 2100 (usually better than 1 mas, very occasionally just outside 1 mas).  The full IAU 2000A model, which is implemented in the function nut00a (q.v.), delivers considerably greater accuracy at current dates;  however, to realize this improved accuracy, corrections for the essentially unpredictable free-core-nutation (FCN) must also be included.\nThe present function provides classical nutation.  The MHB2000SHORT algorithm, from which it is adapted, deals also with (i) the offsets between the GCRS and mean poles and (ii) the adjustments in longitude and obliquity due to the changed precession rates.  These additional functions, namely frame bias and precession adjustments, are supported by the ERFA functions bi00  and pr00.\nThe MHB2000SHORT algorithm also provides \"total\" nutations, comprising the arithmetic sum of the frame bias, precession adjustments, and nutation (luni-solar + planetary).  These total nutations can be used in combination with an existing IAU 1976 precession implementation, such as pmat76,  to deliver GCRS- to-true predictions of mas accuracy at current epochs.  However, for symmetry with the nut00a  function (q.v. for the reasons), the ERFA functions do not generate the \"total nutations\" directly.  Should they be required, they could of course easily be generated by calling bi00, pr00 and the present function and adding the results.\nThe IAU 2000B model includes \"planetary bias\" terms that are fixed in size but compensate for long-period nutations.  The amplitudes quoted in McCarthy & Luzum (2003), namely Dpsi = -1.5835 mas and Depsilon = +1.6339 mas, are optimized for the \"total nutations\" method described in Note 6.  The Luzum (2001) values used in this ERFA implementation, namely -0.135 mas and +0.388 mas, are optimized for the \"rigorous\" method, where frame bias, precession and nutation are applied separately and in that order.  During the interval 1995-2050, the ERFA implementation delivers a maximum error of 1.001 mas (not including FCN).\n\nReferences\n\nLieske, J.H., Lederle, T., Fricke, W., Morando, B., \"Expressions   for the precession quantities based upon the IAU /1976/ system of   astronomical constants\", Astron.Astrophys. 58, 1-2, 1-16.

(2006) Table 1 also contains angles that depend on models distinct from the P03 precession theory itself, namely the IAU 2000A frame bias and nutation.  The quoted polynomials are used in other ERFA functions:\nxy06  contains the polynomial parts of the X and Y series.\ns06  contains the polynomial part of the s+XY/2 series.\npfw06  implements the series for the Fukushima-Williams angles that are with respect to the GCRS pole (i.e. the variants that include frame bias).\nThe IAU resolution stipulated that the choice of parameterization was left to the user, and so an IAU compliant precession implementation can be constructed using various combinations of the angles returned by the present function.\nThe parameterization used by ERFA is the version of the Fukushima- Williams angles that refers directly to the GCRS pole.  These angles may be calculated by calling the function pfw06.  ERFA also supports the direct computation of the CIP GCRS X,Y by series, available by calling xy06.\nThe agreement between the different parameterizations is at the 1 microarcsecond level in the present era.\nWhen constructing a precession formulation that refers to the GCRS pole rather than the dynamical pole, it may (depending on the choice of angles) be necessary to introduce the frame bias explicitly.\nIt is permissible to re-use the same variable in the returned arguments.  The quantities are stored in the stated order.\n\nReference\n\nHilton, J. et al., 2006, Celest.Mech.Dyn.Astron. 94, 351\n\nCalled\n\nobl06: mean obliquity, IAU 2006\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.p2pv","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.p2pv","text":"p2pv(p)\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse [p, zeros(3)] instead.\n\nExtend a p-vector to a pv-vector by appending a zero velocity.\n\nGiven\n\np: P-vector\n\nReturned\n\npv: Pv-vector\n\nCalled\n\nerfa_cp: copy p-vector\nzp: zero p-vector\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.p2s-Tuple{Any}","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.p2s","text":"p2s(p)\n\nP-vector to spherical polar coordinates.\n\nGiven\n\np: P-vector\n\nReturned\n\ntheta: Longitude angle (radians)\nphi: Latitude angle (radians)\nr: Radial distance\n\nNotes\n\nIf P is null, zero theta, phi and r are returned.\nAt either pole, zero theta is returned.\n\nCalled\n\nc2s: p-vector to spherical\npm: modulus of p-vector\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.pap-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.pap","text":"pap(a, b)\n\nPosition-angle from two p-vectors.\n\nGiven\n\na: Direction of reference point\nb: Direction of point whose PA is required\n\nReturned\n\nPosition angle of b with respect to a (radians)\n\nNotes\n\nThe result is the position angle, in radians, of direction b with respect to direction a.

The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nIn accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.\nThe proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB Julian year.\nThe parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.\nCare is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the parallax is in arcseconds.\nThe RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec) before use.\nStraight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is assumed.\nAn extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is overridden to ensure that the object is at a finite but very large distance, but not so large that the proper motion is equivalent to a large but safe speed (about 0.1c using the chosen constant).  A warning status of 1 is added to the status if this action has been taken.\nIf the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the constant VMAX in the function starpv), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.\nThe relativistic adjustment carried out in the starpv function involves an iterative calculation.  If the process fails to converge within a set number of iterations, 4 is added to the status.\n\nCalled\n\nseps: angle between two points\nstarpm: update star catalog data for space motion\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.pn","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.pn","text":"pn(p)\n\nConvert a p-vector into modulus and unit vector.\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse (LinearAlgebra.norm(p), LinearAlgebra.normalize(p)) instead.\n\nGiven\n\np: P-vector\n\nReturned\n\nr: Modulus\nu: Unit vector\n\nNotes\n\nIf p is null, the result is null.

The absolute accuracy of the present formulation is better than 0.1 arcsec from 1960AD to 2040AD, better than 1 arcsec from 1640AD to 2360AD, and remains below 3 arcsec for the whole of the period 500BC to 3000AD.

Proper motion and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary \"proper\" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-velocity data;  moreover, the supplied pv-vector is likely to be merely an intermediate result (for example generated by the function starpv), so that a change of time unit will cancel out overall.\nIn accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.\nSummarizing, the specified pv-vector is for most stars almost identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical \"space motion\" transformation to the catalog data.  The differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper cited below, are:\nIn stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion, the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic, effect.\nThe transformation complies with special relativity.\nCare is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but the pv-vector result is in au and au/day.\nThe proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per Julian year.  The RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true angle, and will thus be numerically larger at high declinations.\nStraight-line motion at constant speed in the inertial frame is assumed.  If the speed is greater than or equal to the speed of light, the function aborts with an error status.\nThe inverse transformation is performed by the function starpv.\n\nCalled\n\npn: decompose p-vector into modulus and direction\npdp: scalar product of two p-vectors\nsxp: multiply p-vector by scalar\npmp: p-vector minus p-vector\npm: modulus of p-vector\nppp: p-vector plus p-vector\npv2s: pv-vector to spherical\nanp: normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi\n\nReference\n\nStumpff, P., 1985, Astron.Astrophys. 144, 232-240.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.pvtob-NTuple{7, Any}","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.pvtob","text":"pvtob(elong, phi, height, xp, yp, sp, theta)\n\nPosition and velocity of a terrestrial observing station.\n\nGiven\n\nelong: Longitude (radians, east +ve, Note 1)\nphi: Latitude (geodetic, radians, Note 1)\nhm: Height above ref. ellipsoid (geodetic, m)\nxp, yp: Coordinates of the pole (radians, Note 2)\nsp: The TIO locator s' (radians, Note 2)\ntheta: Earth rotation angle (radians, Note 3)\n\nReturned\n\npv: Position/velocity vector (m, m/s, CIRS)\n\nNotes\n\nThe terrestrial coordinates are with respect to the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.\nxp and yp are the coordinates (in radians) of the Celestial Intermediate Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial Reference System (see IERS Conventions), measured along the meridians 0 and 90 deg west respectively.  sp is the TIO locator s', in radians, which positions the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin on the equator.

The J2000 method is best matched to the way the argument is handled internally and will deliver the optimum resolution.  The MJD method and the date & time methods are both good compromises between resolution and convenience.\nIn accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.\nThe proper motions are the rate of change of the right ascension and declination at the catalog epoch and are in radians per TDB Julian year.\nThe parallax and radial velocity are in the same frame.\nCare is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the parallax is in arcseconds.\nThe RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec) before use.\nStraight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is assumed.\nAn extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted to mean that the object is on the \"celestial sphere\", the radius of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the starpv function for the value used).

Proper motion and radial velocity are, strictly, in terms of barycentric coordinate time, TCB.  For most practical applications, it is permissible to neglect the distinction between TCB and ordinary \"proper\" time on Earth (TT/TAI).  The result will, as a rule, be limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the proper-motion and radial-velocity data;  moreover, the pv-vector is likely to be merely an intermediate result, so that a change of time unit would cancel out overall.\nIn accordance with normal star-catalog conventions, the object's right ascension and declination are freed from the effects of secular aberration.  The frame, which is aligned to the catalog equator and equinox, is Lorentzian and centered on the SSB.\nThe resulting position and velocity pv-vector is with respect to the same frame and, like the catalog coordinates, is freed from the effects of secular aberration.  Should the \"coordinate direction\", where the object was located at the catalog epoch, be required, it may be obtained by calculating the magnitude of the position vector pv[0][0-2] dividing by the speed of light in au/day to give the light-time, and then multiplying the space velocity pv[1][0-2] by this light-time and adding the result to pv[0][0-2].\nSummarizing, the pv-vector returned is for most stars almost identical to the result of applying the standard geometrical \"space motion\" transformation.  The differences, which are the subject of the Stumpff paper referenced below, are:\nIn stars with significant radial velocity and proper motion, the constantly changing light-time distorts the apparent proper motion.  Note that this is a classical, not a relativistic, effect.\nThe transformation complies with special relativity.\nCare is needed with units.  The star coordinates are in radians and the proper motions in radians per Julian year, but the parallax is in arcseconds; the radial velocity is in km/s, but the pv-vector result is in au and au/day.\nThe RA proper motion is in terms of coordinate angle, not true angle.  If the catalog uses arcseconds for both RA and Dec proper motions, the RA proper motion will need to be divided by cos(Dec) before use.\nStraight-line motion at constant speed, in the inertial frame, is assumed.\nAn extremely small (or zero or negative) parallax is interpreted to mean that the object is on the \"celestial sphere\", the radius of which is an arbitrary (large) value (see the constant PXMIN). When the distance is overridden in this way, the status, initially zero, has 1 added to it.\nIf the space velocity is a significant fraction of c (see the constant VMAX), it is arbitrarily set to zero.  When this action occurs, 2 is added to the status.\nThe relativistic adjustment involves an iterative calculation. If the process fails to converge within a set number (IMAX) of iterations, 4 is added to the status.\nThe inverse transformation is performed by the function pvstar.\n\nCalled\n\ns2pv: spherical coordinates to pv-vector\npm: modulus of p-vector\nzp: zero p-vector\npn: decompose p-vector into modulus and direction\npdp: scalar product of two p-vectors\nsxp: multiply p-vector by scalar\npmp: p-vector minus p-vector\nppp: p-vector plus p-vector\n\nReference\n\nStumpff, P., 1985, Astron.Astrophys. 144, 232-240.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.sxp","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.sxp","text":"sxp(s, p)\n\nMultiply a p-vector by a scalar.\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse s .* p instead.\n\nGiven\n\ns: Scalar\np: P-vector\n\nReturned\n\nsp: S * p\n\nNote\n\nIt is permissible for p and sp to be the same array.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.sxpv","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.sxpv","text":"sxpv(s, pv)\n\nMultiply a pv-vector by a scalar.\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse s .* pv instead.\n\nGiven\n\ns: Scalar\npv: Pv-vector\n\nReturned\n\nspv: s * pv\n\nNote\n\nIt is permissible for pv and spv to be the same array\n\nCalled\n\ns2xpv: multiply pv-vector by two scalars\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.taitt","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.taitt","text":"taitt(tai1, tai2)\n\nTime scale transformation:  International Atomic Time, TAI, to Terrestrial Time, TT.\n\nGiven\n\ntai1, tai2: TAI as a 2-part Julian Date\n\nReturned\n\ntt1, tt2: TT as a 2-part Julian Date\n\nNote\n\ntai1+tai2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way    between the two arguments, for example where tai1 is the Julian    Day Number and tai2 is the fraction of a day.

Writing (a,b) for the celestial spherical coordinates of the star, the sequence of rotations is (a+pi/2) around the z-axis followed by (pi/2-b) around the x-axis.\nIf vector v0 is not of unit length, or if vector v is of zero length, the results will be wrong.\nIf v0 points at a pole, the returned (xi,eta) will be based on the arbitrary assumption that the longitude coordinate of the tangent point is zero.\nThis function is a member of the following set:\nspherical vector solve for\ntpxes tpxev xi,eta\ntpsts tpstv star\ntpors tporv origin\n\nReferences\n\nCalabretta M.R. & Greisen, E.W., 2002, \"Representations of celestial coordinates in FITS\", Astron.Astrophys. 395, 1077\nGreen, R.M., \"Spherical Astronomy\", Cambridge University Press, 1987, Chapter 13.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.tr","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.tr","text":"tr(r)\n\nTranspose an r-matrix.\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse r' instead.\n\nGiven\n\nr: R-matrix\n\nReturned\n\nrt: Transpose\n\nNote\n\nIt is permissible for r and rt to be the same array.\n\nCalled\n\ncr: copy r-matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.trxp","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.trxp","text":"trxp(r, p)\n\nMultiply a p-vector by the transpose of an r-matrix.\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse r' * p instead.\n\nGiven\n\nr: R-matrix\np: P-vector\n\nReturned\n\ntrp: R * p\n\nNote\n\nIt is permissible for p and trp to be the same array.\n\nCalled\n\ntr: transpose r-matrix\nrxp: product of r-matrix and p-vector\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.trxpv","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.trxpv","text":"trxpv(r, pv)\n\nMultiply a pv-vector by the transpose of an r-matrix.\n\nwarning: Deprecated\nUse [r' * pv[1], r' * pv[2]] instead.\n\nGiven\n\nr: R-matrix\npv: Pv-vector\n\nReturned\n\ntrpv: R * pv\n\nNote\n\nIt is permissible for pv and trpv to be the same array.\n\nCalled\n\ntr: transpose r-matrix\nrxpv: product of r-matrix and pv-vector\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/functions/#ERFA.tttai","page":"Functions","title":"ERFA.tttai","text":"tttai(tt1, tt2)\n\nTime scale transformation:  Terrestrial Time, TT, to International Atomic Time, TAI.\n\nGiven\n\ntt1, tt2: TT as a 2-part Julian Date\n\nReturned\n\ntai1, tai2: TAI as a 2-part Julian Date\n\nNote\n\ntt1+tt2 is Julian Date, apportioned in any convenient way between    the two arguments, for example where tt1 is the Julian Day Number    and tt2 is the fraction of a day.
