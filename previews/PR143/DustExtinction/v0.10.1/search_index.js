To avoid being asked to  download the files, set the environment variable DATADEPS_ALWAYS_ACCEPT to   true. You can also provide the directory of the two requisite files manually   instead of relying on DataDeps.jl. Internally, this type keeps the FITS files   defining the map open, speeding up repeated queries for E(B-V) values.\n\nReferences\n\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner and Davis (1998)\n\n\n\n\n\n(dustmap::SFD98Map)(l::Real, b::Real)\n(dustmap::SFD98Map)(l::Quantity, b::Quantity)\n\nGet E(B-V) value from a SFD98Map instance at galactic coordinates (l, b),  given in radians. Uses bilinear interpolation between pixel values.
