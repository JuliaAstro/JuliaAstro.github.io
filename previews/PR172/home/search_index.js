First, we specify the column name as :parallax_gaia. The : syntax defines a Symbol in Julia which is a bit like a string and a variable name. Next, we say what filter we want to apply to this column by passing a key-value Pair constructed with =>. This syntax, e.g. 1 => 2 just groups two values and is unrelated to keyword arguments. Then, we pass a predicate function, that is a function that takes one value and returns true or false. The expression >(50.0) produces such a function that takes a value and compares it with 50.0 milliarcseconds of parallax.
