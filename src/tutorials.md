Welcome! This page contains links to general tutorials useful to astronomers and astrophysicists getting started with Julia.

In Julia, smaller focussed packages are preferred. This page shows how you can combine smaller packages to get big results!

For more advanced usage examples, please see the documentation pages of the individual packages linked on the [Ecosystem](@ref eco) page.
